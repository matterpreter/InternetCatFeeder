# Internet Cat Feeder
Raspberry Pi internet-enabled cat feeder using the PicoBorg Reverse.  
*Still in development.*

I wanted to have a way to feed my cats while I am out of town, so I started this project. A Raspberry Pi is connected to a PicoBorg Reverse which is then connected to a battery pack and a 68oz. stepper motor. The stepper will be connected to a dry food dispenser to turn the handle the specified amount (currently 360 deg for normal and 1080 for "large") or attempt to unjam the feeder. Please note that I do not recommend opening this up to the internet quite yet unless you want to have the whole world feed your cats.

Please excuse my clumsy programming :)
